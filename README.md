# okcoders-final-project
Bootstrap website

In October and November 2015, I participated in <a href="http:\\www.okcoders.com"> OK Coders</a>, an 8-week bootcamp in full-stack webdevelopment. OK Coders is sponsored by University of Oklahoma’s Center for the Creation of Economic Wealth and local startup Tailwind to meet Oklahoma’s growing demand for software developers. The course covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, and Express.

This project represents the final project I put together for the course.

This website is put together using Bootstrap 3.5 and is fully responsive. It utilizies a Navbar, Dropdowns, Carousel, and Accordion collapse components.
