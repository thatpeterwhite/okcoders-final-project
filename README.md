# okcoders-final-project
Bootstrap website

In October and November 2015, I participated in <a href="http:\\www.okcoders.com"> OK Coders</a>, an 8-week bootcamp in full-stack webdevelopment. OK Coders is sponsored by University of Oklahoma’s Center for the Creation of Economic Wealth and local startup Tailwind to meet Oklahoma’s growing demand for software developers. The course covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, and Express.

This project represents a project I put together for the course.

This website is constructed using Bootstrap 3.5 and is fully responsive. It utilizes a Navbar menu across the top. Dropdown options can be viewed by clicking on the "Serve" or "My Profile" menu buttons. A Carousel component rotates a series of three images with captions.  Accordion collapse components expand and hide text and link options at the bottom of the page with each of the "Learn More" links.
